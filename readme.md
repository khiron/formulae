Mathematical formulae
=====================

This is a collection of mathematical formulae that the contributors have discovered in the process of High school, undergraduate, and post graduate education.  If you find any errors, please let us know.

The formulae are divided into the following categories:

* [Algebra](algebra.md)
* [Calculus](calculus.md)
* [Combinatorics](combinatorics.md)
* [Geometry](geometry.md)
* [Logic](logic.md)
* [Number theory](number-theory.md)
* [Probability](probability.md)
* [Statistics](statistics.md)
* [Trigonometry](trigonometry.md)

The formulae are written in LaTeX, and can be compiled into PDFs using the included `Makefile`.  Note you have to install pandoc and LaTeX to compile the PDFs.
